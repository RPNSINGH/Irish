## Overview
This is a simple Tkinter app trained with machine learning algorithms. The trained model (`Tkinter_GUI`) takes inputs (*ie sepal length  ,sepal width ,petal length ,petal width,*) as an input and predicts flower name.

## Motivation
Lets Predict because we can.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:
1. Data analysis visulization and models :
    - Using pandas to open and manipulate CSV file in jupyter notebook.
    - Visulization using :
      - Seaborn 
      - Matplotlib 
    - Model selection and model training 
      - Decision Tree
      - Random Forest Classifier
      - SVM
      - KNN

2. GUI (Tkinter)

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries

## To Do
1. Convert the app to Django plateform.
2. Add a better vizualization chart to display the predictions.

## Bug Request
If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an issue [here](https://github.com/RPNSINGH/Irish/issues/new) by including your search query and the expected result.

If you'd like to request a new function, feel free to do so by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/RPNSINGH/Irish/issues/new). Please include sample queries and their corresponding results.
